Hello Debbie Jo!
You get 3 attempts per question.
Now let the fun begin!

+-------------------------------------------+

#1  What does 4+1 = 5
    WooHoo!! Correct :)

Do you want to continue (y=yes | n=no): abc
Sorry invalid input. Please try again.
Do you want to continue (y=yes | n=no): YES

+-------------------------------------------+

#2  What does 30/3 = 30
    Bummer, that was incorrect.
    You have 2 attempts left.

#2  What does 30/3 = 3
    Bummer, that was incorrect.
    You have 1 attempts left.

#2  What does 30/3 = 1
    Sorry, you are out of attempts.
    The correct answer is 10.

Do you want to continue (y=yes | n=no): y

PSEUDOCODE
==========
declare variables
2B: declare the 2D vector
display the welcome header
get the user's name
welcome the user to the game
seed the random function

outer while loop to keep looping if the user wants to continue (y or yes)
    add one to the total number of questions
    generate random numbers
    flip the numbers
    switch to setup the math type
	
	2B: declare a new vector row to store the current question information
	    and initalize the left number, question type, and right number	

    for loop to give the user 3 attempts to answer the question correctly
        display question
        
        get user's answer using while loop to validate numeric input
        
        if userAnswer is correct 
			2B: push back the number of attempts to the end of the row vector
            add to the correct counter, display correct, and break out 
        else 
			2B: push back 0 to the end of the row vector
            tell the user they were incorrect, and how many attempts left
            if the user is out of attempts then display the correct answer
    end of for loop
	
	2B: push back row to the end of the 2D vector

    inner while loop until the user enters a valid input (y, yes, n, no)
        for loop to lower case the user's input
        if valid input 
            break out
         else 
            tell them invalid
    end of inner while loop
    
end of outer while loop to keep game looping

2B: display the detail report header
2B: for loop through the 2D vector
	pull the current row data out of the 2D vector
	example: leftNum = mathQuestions.at(i).at(0);
	switch to assign correctAnswer and questionOp
		NOTE: divide will have the same logic as the other types
		NOTE: default to display a return error -2
	display the current question information
	if-else to display attempts or invalid
	
display the user's stats
display end of program
